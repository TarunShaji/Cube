now.","startTime":"00:14","endTime":"00:17","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And.","startTime":"00:18","endTime":"00:18","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There is one brand campaign, ppc, another PPC for I think existing customers, and then quite a few PMAX campaigns.","startTime":"00:20","endTime":"00:29","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I'll just go through these quickly.","startTime":"00:30","endTime":"00:32","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"First, let's analyze the brand campaign.","startTime":"00:33","endTime":"00:35","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This is your brand campaign.","startTime":"00:37","endTime":"00:38","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The issue right now is because of the phrase match for a lot of keywords.","startTime":"00:40","endTime":"00:44","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"A lot of terms are hidden.","startTime":"00:46","endTime":"00:48","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because in search term reports in Google you don't know, they don't show you all the search term.","startTime":"00:48","endTime":"00:54","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"In our brand campaign, a lot of it therefore is diluted.","startTime":"00:54","endTime":"00:58","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We have to see how to solve that because most of like the 6,000 spend is going into terms that are not visible to us.","startTime":"00:58","endTime":"01:09","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And the difference is that for the visible terms, the cost per acquisition is $18 and for the invisible terms, hidden terms, cost per acquisition is $52.","startTime":"01:10","endTime":"01:20","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There might be.","startTime":"01:21","endTime":"01:22","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There.","startTime":"01:22","endTime":"01:22","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We have to see how we maybe we split this brand campaign into two parts, one with exactum and then another with phrase match.","startTime":"01:22","endTime":"01:30","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because in this we have both exact and phrase.","startTime":"01:30","endTime":"01:34","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that's why the ROAS can improve significantly for just the exact match.","startTime":"01:34","endTime":"01:40","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But if we do.","startTime":"01:40","endTime":"01:41","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But we might do some revenue.","startTime":"01:42","endTime":"01:44","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we'll have to see how we keep the revenue and increase the roas.","startTime":"01:44","endTime":"01:48","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This is.","startTime":"01:48","endTime":"01:49","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, the hidden terms is.","startTime":"01:49","endTime":"01:51","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It says on the previous page Google hides that.","startTime":"01:51","endTime":"01:54","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you don't know what's like.","startTime":"01:54","endTime":"01:57","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So this means basically you do not know who and why Google shows the search terms and we are spending $6,000 a month to that.","startTime":"01:57","endTime":"02:09","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, it's not really definitely wrong.","startTime":"02:10","endTime":"02:13","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"02:13","endTime":"02:13","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But yes, that's what is happening.","startTime":"02:13","endTime":"02:15","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"A part of it needs to be fixed because in our brand campaign.","startTime":"02:15","endTime":"02:19","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I'll try and show you on my screen, just give me one second.","startTime":"02:20","endTime":"02:24","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How would you be able to.","startTime":"02:24","endTime":"02:25","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"How can you fix it if it's not visible to you?","startTime":"02:25","endTime":"02:28","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Oh, so in the brand campaign there are exact match keywords and phrase match keywords.","startTime":"02:29","endTime":"02:34","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So exact match.","startTime":"02:36","endTime":"02:37","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Just give me one second.","startTime":"02:37","endTime":"02:38","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'm trying to share my screen.","startTime":"02:38","endTime":"02:41","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Can you.","startTime":"02:44","endTime":"02:45","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yes, I can see it.","startTime":"02:46","endTime":"02:47","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"02:47","endTime":"02:48","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So this is your.","startTime":"02:49","endTime":"02:52","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Let me just go to your brand campaign.","startTime":"02:54","endTime":"02:57","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Give me one second.","startTime":"02:57","endTime":"02:58","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you see on my screen there are match type exact and some are match type phrase.","startTime":"03:13","endTime":"03:19","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Now.","startTime":"03:20","endTime":"03:20","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"For the visible terms, your conversion value upon cost, Your ROAS is 6.07.","startTime":"03:22","endTime":"03:29","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But for the.","startTime":"03:30","endTime":"03:31","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I'll show you quickly.","startTime":"03:31","endTime":"03:33","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But for the other search term, invisible search terms, your conversion value upon cost here ROAS is 1.73.","startTime":"03:34","endTime":"03:42","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That is still getting you 4,000 in revenue.","startTime":"03:43","endTime":"03:46","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So what like.","startTime":"03:48","endTime":"03:49","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"One way to do it is make just the brand campaign is exact match.","startTime":"03:51","endTime":"03:58","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Then Google doesn't bid on like related terms or still somewhat similar.","startTime":"03:59","endTime":"04:05","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But the hidden terms go down from let's say an 80% to 20%.","startTime":"04:06","endTime":"04:12","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right now 80% of your search terms are hidden.","startTime":"04:13","endTime":"04:16","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But you will also lose revenue around 4,000 that is coming.","startTime":"04:17","endTime":"04:23","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But the remaining revenue will come at a like much higher almost 1.4 times ROAS.","startTime":"04:23","endTime":"04:30","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Although at the same time this revenue is not necessarily lost because PMAX might actually catch it.","startTime":"04:30","endTime":"04:37","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Does that make sense?","startTime":"04:39","endTime":"04:40","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"04:41","endTime":"04:42","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"04:42","endTime":"04:42","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So yeah, that's.","startTime":"04:42","endTime":"04:43","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's one thing.","startTime":"04:43","endTime":"04:44","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'll just quickly go through.","startTime":"04:46","endTime":"04:47","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you see, even if you like just you're doing just exact match or the phrase matches that are matching the visible search terms exact match, then you will see a much higher roas.","startTime":"04:49","endTime":"05:02","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"05:03","endTime":"05:03","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Then some of the brand terms are on.","startTime":"05:05","endTime":"05:10","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like they are bidding for competitive terms.","startTime":"05:12","endTime":"05:13","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Also we have to remove those from the ads and that needs to be that will just save us money.","startTime":"05:13","endTime":"05:20","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So this is obviously wrong.","startTime":"05:20","endTime":"05:22","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That part was debatable wrong.","startTime":"05:22","endTime":"05:24","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This part is obviously wrong.","startTime":"05:24","endTime":"05:25","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like we should not be.","startTime":"05:25","endTime":"05:27","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We are just wasting money and we are getting zero conversion.","startTime":"05:27","endTime":"05:29","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So out of this $171 spent.","startTime":"05:29","endTime":"05:31","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This is.","startTime":"05:31","endTime":"05:32","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And there might be few other variations of these which we are spending money on in brand.","startTime":"05:32","endTime":"05:37","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Campaign which doesn't make sense.","startTime":"05:39","endTime":"05:41","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that's.","startTime":"05:41","endTime":"05:42","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So these are the major two things in the brand campaign.","startTime":"05:42","endTime":"05:45","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The roas of brand campaign should be much higher.","startTime":"05:45","endTime":"05:47","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right now we are at around three, which is very low.","startTime":"05:47","endTime":"05:50","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And we traditionally our brand campaign used to do better.","startTime":"05:52","endTime":"05:55","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'll show you how our brand campaign used to do traditionally.","startTime":"05:55","endTime":"05:58","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like if you.","startTime":"06:00","endTime":"06:01","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"If you just see the performance of brand.","startTime":"06:03","endTime":"06:05","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"My screen is visible, right?","startTime":"06:06","endTime":"06:08","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yes, it's visible.","startTime":"06:08","endTime":"06:10","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, so if I do like all time then.","startTime":"06:10","endTime":"06:16","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or not all time.","startTime":"06:19","endTime":"06:21","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Let's just do.","startTime":"06:21","endTime":"06:22","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'll give you conversion value.","startTime":"06:29","endTime":"06:31","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The roas.","startTime":"06:31","endTime":"06:32","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The roas of brand used to be higher.","startTime":"06:32","endTime":"06:34","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It used to be in this.","startTime":"06:53","endTime":"06:54","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Eight.","startTime":"06:57","endTime":"06:57","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It used touch eight also.","startTime":"06:57","endTime":"06:59","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Now consistently it is around.","startTime":"06:59","endTime":"07:01","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"In three something range.","startTime":"07:03","endTime":"07:05","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's.","startTime":"07:05","endTime":"07:06","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Again one of the big reason is why it's falling from like a much higher 7 and 8 to this is because search terms are diluted a lot.","startTime":"07:09","endTime":"07:17","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we might be bidding.","startTime":"07:17","endTime":"07:18","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The campaign is bidding on a lot of things that it should not be bidding on.","startTime":"07:18","endTime":"07:21","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Anyway so moving on to the next one.","startTime":"07:22","endTime":"07:24","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Oh, is my screen visible.","startTime":"07:24","endTime":"07:26","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Sliding?","startTime":"07:28","endTime":"07:29","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think.","startTime":"07:29","endTime":"07:29","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"07:30","endTime":"07:30","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Is it visible?","startTime":"07:34","endTime":"07:35","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So when you run ads account for your other brands, like what do you.","startTime":"07:36","endTime":"07:42","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"See normally I Mean generally for.","startTime":"07:42","endTime":"07:46","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like we generally run a exact match campaign for.","startTime":"07:48","endTime":"07:53","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"For brand.","startTime":"07:53","endTime":"07:54","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There are like in your case, the phrase match is just bringing in 50% of.","startTime":"07:54","endTime":"08:00","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Of revenue, which is not a very common thing to see and because.","startTime":"08:01","endTime":"08:07","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, it is because people do not know the brand.","startTime":"08:07","endTime":"08:10","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"08:10","endTime":"08:11","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But they search for a phone case, iPhone 17 Pro Max phone case, and they kind of see our item next to it and then they click.","startTime":"08:11","endTime":"08:21","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's a little bit.","startTime":"08:21","endTime":"08:23","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think unique phone case is a little bit different.","startTime":"08:24","endTime":"08:27","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"08:28","endTime":"08:28","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Let's say than a bag.","startTime":"08:28","endTime":"08:29","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But at the same time, that should be catered.","startTime":"08:30","endTime":"08:33","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Those queries should be catered by some other campaign, not the brand campaign.","startTime":"08:33","endTime":"08:38","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Brand campaign should be just like Blackbrook and Berkeley.","startTime":"08:39","endTime":"08:42","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That used to be.","startTime":"08:42","endTime":"08:43","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"08:44","endTime":"08:44","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, so that's my point with this.","startTime":"08:44","endTime":"08:47","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Now let's come to the good now.","startTime":"08:47","endTime":"08:50","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, so this.","startTime":"08:50","endTime":"08:52","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This is the PMAX campaign.","startTime":"08:53","endTime":"08:55","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I can't.","startTime":"08:56","endTime":"08:57","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"As soon as I go full screen, it stops sharing.","startTime":"08:57","endTime":"09:01","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Is it visible?","startTime":"09:02","endTime":"09:03","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No, not.","startTime":"09:03","endTime":"09:05","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, so let me try.","startTime":"09:06","endTime":"09:09","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This.","startTime":"09:12","endTime":"09:12","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yes, we can see now.","startTime":"09:15","endTime":"09:17","speaker_name":"Sahana K","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Okay, so now you see there are five pmax campaigns which are live.","startTime":"09:17","endTime":"09:22","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So one is catch all.","startTime":"09:23","endTime":"09:25","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Other is iPhone 17 Pro Max wallet.","startTime":"09:25","endTime":"09:28","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Other is iPhone 17 Pro wallet.","startTime":"09:28","endTime":"09:30","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Another is 17 Pro Max snap on and 17 Pro snap on.","startTime":"09:31","endTime":"09:35","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"09:36","endTime":"09:37","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The first one has a roas of five plus.","startTime":"09:37","endTime":"09:41","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And why?","startTime":"09:42","endTime":"09:43","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because it has a good ad strength.","startTime":"09:43","endTime":"09:45","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You can see ad strength column.","startTime":"09:45","endTime":"09:46","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It has audience signals.","startTime":"09:48","endTime":"09:50","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But all others have a ROAS of around 1.","startTime":"09:51","endTime":"09:55","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you're basically losing money on all these, all four.","startTime":"09:55","endTime":"09:58","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And it's a very clear reason why.","startTime":"09:58","endTime":"10:01","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because your ad strength is poor, you have no audience signals, your assets.","startTime":"10:01","endTime":"10:06","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What would you do here?","startTime":"10:06","endTime":"10:08","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"For example, is it because the photos or videos in these iPhone 17 Pro Max wallet assets is weak or is it the search terms keywords?","startTime":"10:08","endTime":"10:22","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What is the problem in.","startTime":"10:22","endTime":"10:24","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"In pmax, there are just like.","startTime":"10:24","endTime":"10:26","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, you have to give like phrases which is.","startTime":"10:26","endTime":"10:29","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And most of these systems are overlapping, like iPhone 17 Pro Wallet.","startTime":"10:30","endTime":"10:36","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You are actually selling at a much higher roas in catch all.","startTime":"10:36","endTime":"10:40","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You are selling the same thing at a much lower roas in this because your overall ad strength is bad, your assets are bad.","startTime":"10:40","endTime":"10:48","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, what would you.","startTime":"10:48","endTime":"10:49","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"How would you fix it?","startTime":"10:49","endTime":"10:51","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we will have to.","startTime":"10:51","endTime":"10:52","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"First of all, we have to pause all these four campaigns.","startTime":"10:52","endTime":"10:55","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's completely pointless running it in this form.","startTime":"10:55","endTime":"10:57","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"These campaign data, the learning, everything is completely polluted.","startTime":"10:57","endTime":"11:01","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, okay, you will see.","startTime":"11:01","endTime":"11:04","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How are we going to advertise our iPhone 17 detachable wallet cases?","startTime":"11:04","endTime":"11:10","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You are selling those in your catch all campaign already.","startTime":"11:11","endTime":"11:14","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, you are Already selling.","startTime":"11:15","endTime":"11:17","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We don't need to have like we just need one catch all campaign.","startTime":"11:17","endTime":"11:22","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's enough.","startTime":"11:22","endTime":"11:23","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Correct.","startTime":"11:23","endTime":"11:24","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you need one catch all campaign in pmax.","startTime":"11:24","endTime":"11:26","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then let's say some of the keywords are doing really

these.","startTime":"11:34","endTime":"11:38","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What's happening is all your campaigns are fighting for the same

assets.","startTime":"11:42","endTime":"11:46","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But some, in some cases, some other campaigns are getting conversions and those conversions are coming at like 3x4x the cost.","startTime":"11:46","endTime":"11:53","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you're losing money in all four.","startTime":"11:54","endTime":"11:56","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How.","startTime":"11:58","endTime":"11:59","speaker_name":"Serkan

never.","startTime":"12:10","endTime":"12:11","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or the terms like is it does catch all means someone comes to your site and you kind of.","startTime":"12:11","endTime":"12:19","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Is it like not retargeting, right?","startTime":"12:19","endTime":"12:21","speaker_name":"Serkan

things.","startTime":"13:53","endTime":"13:54","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I'll come to this why there might be a lot more.","startTime":"13:54","endTime":"13:58","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So Pebble Black is from somehow not converting through

this.","startTime":"15:31","endTime":"15:32","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Now the next section covers the feed

to Google Merchant center or you're gonna use the Google's app on Shopify to push the feed properly?","startTime":"16:05","endTime":"16:15","speaker_name":"Serkan

Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But if the feed is a problem.","startTime":"16:20","endTime":"16:23","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So after you manually fix it the

also.","startTime":"16:31","endTime":"16:37","speaker_name":"Sahana K","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We can also do it manually.","startTime":"16:37","endTime":"16:38","speaker_name":"Sahana K","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So we'll do.","startTime":"16:38","endTime":"16:39","speaker_name":"Sahana K","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We don't know what the current source is.","startTime":"16:39","endTime":"16:40","speaker_name":"Sahana K","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Based on the current source we'll make the

K","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Okay, this will have to look in.","startTime":"16:45","endTime":"16:46","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, we.","startTime":"16:46","endTime":"16:47","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This is.","startTime":"16:47","endTime":"16:48","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah this we have fixed for everybody.","startTime":"16:48","endTime":"16:50","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"In fact feed analysis is one of the most important thing for pmax.","startTime":"16:50","endTime":"16:53","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So overall this is what I got in quick analysis of the feed and all of this is done in like.","startTime":"16:53","endTime":"17:00","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"A couple of hours.","startTime":"17:02","endTime":"17:03","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So but around 900/870 are in stock 65 order stock.","startTime":"17:03","endTime":"17:09","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There are three critical issues that I found.","startTime":"17:09","endTime":"17:11","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"First one is the variant grouping is missing.","startTime":"17:11","endTime":"17:14","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So for example.","startTime":"17:14","endTime":"17:15","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Read snap on case.","startTime":"17:17","endTime":"17:18","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There are 14 color variants but item group ID is not given.","startTime":"17:19","endTime":"17:23","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So these are.","startTime":"17:24","endTime":"17:25","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, this is the exact same thing we have been trying to fix with the review app.","startTime":"17:26","endTime":"17:32","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Actually I have been trying to explain them that we need a group ID because if our products are single sku we need to in order for them to actually show on Google with the same number of reviews.","startTime":"17:32","endTime":"17:46","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I want to group them but they couldn't figure that we asked Google and all that stuff like Sahana knows for example new Barlow case.","startTime":"17:46","endTime":"17:55","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I want all Barlow cases with different devices and colors in the same item group ID but didn't like couldn't do it for the last I think three.","startTime":"17:55","endTime":"18:05","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Weeks now we couldn't do it.","startTime":"18:05","endTime":"18:07","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Why Sahana?","startTime":"18:08","endTime":"18:09","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No, not Sahana.","startTime":"18:09","endTime":"18:11","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Sahana knows the like products a little bit.","startTime":"18:11","endTime":"18:13","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's why like we have products called Barlo but we have it for four different devices and with five each color.","startTime":"18:13","endTime":"18:20","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So there's 20 variants but that they don't look like variant.","startTime":"18:20","endTime":"18:25","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They're all separate products.","startTime":"18:25","endTime":"18:26","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we I was trying to tell Google these are all same products, same model so they should show same number of product reviews.","startTime":"18:27","endTime":"18:38","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But it's like too technical.","startTime":"18:38","endTime":"18:40","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Google didn't know and like Google didn't.","startTime":"18:40","endTime":"18:44","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Know I said I did not understand Circuit the Google representative didn't know Google.","startTime":"18:44","endTime":"18:49","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, like they say put mpn.","startTime":"18:50","endTime":"18:54","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Which would be like in let's say read.","startTime":"18:57","endTime":"18:59","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"18:59","endTime":"18:59","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we would just read for all the different things as the npn but the review person's review product says you have to make the read as your sku.","startTime":"18:59","endTime":"19:11","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Then I said like that's just gonna confuse everything else and yeah.","startTime":"19:11","endTime":"19:17","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"19:17","endTime":"19:17","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So now I know the problem.","startTime":"19:17","endTime":"19:20","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I was looking for a solution but if we can solve that it will solve the problem with the reviews because one product has two, the other one has 15 like color, different colors has different number of reviews but it's the same product.","startTime":"19:20","endTime":"19:34","speaker_name":"Serkan Demiray","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They should show 17 for both.","startTime":"19:34","endTime":"19:36","speaker_name":"Serkan

this is also is bad for Google Ad because then it's kind of like competing for the same space.","startTime":"19:38","endTime":"19:45","speaker_name":"suhail","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And you're going to be able to fix this part?","startTime":"19:46","endTime":"19:48","speaker_name":"Serkan
